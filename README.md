# Los Angeles Lakers Net Rating Forecasting (2025–26 Season)

This project applies __time series analysis__ to forecast the Los Angeles Lakers’ rolling net rating for the final stretch (7 games) of the 2025–2026 NBA season. Using ARIMA modeling, rolling‑origin cross‑validation, and game‑level advanced metrics, the analysis estimates short‑term performance and provides insight into likely win–loss outcomes and playoff seeding.


**The goal of this project is to:**

- Compute offensive rating (ORtg), defensive rating (DRtg), and net rating (NRtg) from raw game logs (This was done in Excel)

- Smooth volatility using a 3‑game rolling average

- Diagnose stationarity and model structure (to accurately fit a model which suffices our forecasting needs)

- Fit and compare ARIMA models

- Evaluate performance using rolling forecast cross‑validation

- Forecast the next 7 games with 95% prediction intervals

- Interpret results in the context of team performance and playoff implications

- This project demonstrates practical time series modeling on real sports data, with a focus on reproducibility and statistical rigor.

Game logs were obtained from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/), which provides detailed box score and advanced statistics for every NBA game.

Each sheet in the Excel file corresponds to one NBA team. This project focuses on the Los Angeles Lakers (LAL) sheet.

🧮 Methodology
1. Feature Engineering
Using Dean Oliver’s formulas (Basketball on Paper, 2004):

Possessions

Offensive Rating (ORtg)

Defensive Rating (DRtg)

Net Rating (NRtg)

A 3‑game rolling average is applied to reduce noise and capture underlying performance trends.

2. Stationarity & Model Identification
Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) tests

First differencing

ACF/PACF analysis

The differenced series shows stationarity, with PACF suggesting an AR(1) structure.

3. Modeling
Two ARIMA models were compared:

ARIMA(1,1,0)

ARIMA(2,1,0)

Model selection was based on:

AIC / BIC

Parameter significance

Residual diagnostics

Ljung–Box test

ARIMA(1,1,0) was selected as the final model.

4. Cross‑Validation
Rolling‑origin cross‑validation was performed using:

Initial window: 40 games

Forecast horizon: 1 game

Framework: tsibble + fable

This evaluates true out‑of‑sample predictive performance.

5. Forecasting
A 7‑game ahead forecast was generated with 95% prediction intervals.
The forecast exhibits:

A flat mean trajectory (typical for ARIMA on volatile data)

Wide intervals reflecting uncertainty in NBA outcomes

📈 Results Summary
The ARIMA(1,1,0) model captures the main structure of the rolling net rating series.

Forecasted net ratings for the next 7 games remain near zero with wide uncertainty bands.

Opponent average net ratings were compared to forecast intervals to estimate likely outcomes.

The projected final record is 52–30, placing the Lakers 4th in the Western Conference.

⚠️ Limitations
Time series models assume the future resembles the past — a challenge in sports analytics due to:

Injuries

Roster changes

Home/away effects

Opponent strength

Schedule density

These factors are not explicitly modeled in ARIMA.

🔮 Extensions
Future improvements could include:

ARIMAX / SARIMA with covariates (home/away, injuries, opponent strength)

Logistic regression for win–loss prediction

Bayesian hierarchical models for team‑level uncertainty

Machine learning models (XGBoost, LSTM) for richer feature sets
